# Next.js Web Implementation Guide (Phase 1)

## High-Level Architecture Overview

The application is structured as a monorepo containing a Next.js application that serves as both a web front-end and a back-end API. In the future, a React Native mobile app will be added (in Phase 2), but we are focusing on the web implementation first.

The Next.js project provides both web pages for browser-based interaction and API endpoints that will later serve as the backend for the mobile app. Next.js provides a built-in way to create a public API ([Routing: API Routes | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes#:~:text=API%20routes%20provide%20a%20solution,js)), so all backend functionality will be implemented through these API routes.

**Key services/modules:**

- **Authentication & Onboarding:** Manages user sign-up, login, and secure access to the app. The Next.js frontend provides onboarding pages for new users and login forms for returning users.

- **Event Management:** Handles creation and viewing of events, as well as user engagement with events (e.g. RSVPing or joining an event). The web app includes pages to list available events, view event details, and create or edit events. The Next.js API provides endpoints to fetch event lists, retrieve details for a specific event, create new events, and update or delete events as needed. Business logic such as validating event data or managing attendance is handled on the back-end.

- **Chat Messaging:** Enables real-time communication between users (for example, a chat room or messages within an event). The chat feature can be implemented using REST endpoints (e.g. polling for new messages via an API route) or a WebSocket server for instant updates. We'll outline a simple RESTful approach initially, with the option to extend to real-time later.

- **User Profile Handling:** Manages user profile data (viewing and editing profile information). The front-end has a profile page where users can see their information and update details like name, avatar, or preferences. The back-end offers endpoints to fetch the current user's profile and to update profile fields.

All these services are logically separated but work in unison. The web app triggers API calls to the same Next.js server, and the back-end responds with the required data or action results. This unified codebase ensures consistency and allows engineers to work on front-end and back-end modules in parallel.

## Project Directory Structure

The project is organized to clearly separate the web/back-end app and any shared code or configuration:

```
project-root/
├── package.json               # Root package.json with workspaces, scripts, etc.
├── packages/
│   ├── web/                   # Next.js app (back-end and web front-end)
│   │   ├── package.json       # Web app package config
│   │   ├── app/               # Next.js app directory (for web UI and API routes)
│   │   │   ├── api/           # Next.js API route handlers (Node.js backend functions)
│   │   │   └── ...            # Next.js pages or components for web interface
│   │   └── next.config.js     # Next.js configuration
│   └── shared/                # (Optional) Shared code (utilities, types, components)
│       ├── package.json
│       └── utils/             # Example: utility functions used by both frontend and backend
├── node_modules/              # Dependencies (managed by workspace)
└── package-lock.json
```

Key parts of the structure and their roles:

- **Root `package.json`:** Declares the workspace packages (e.g. `packages/*`) and contains any root-level dependencies and scripts. The root is marked `private: true` to prevent accidental publishing of the monorepo.

- **`packages/web`:** Contains the Next.js application. This project serves as our **back-end** (via Next's API routes) and the **web front-end**. The `app/api/` folder includes route handlers that implement the backend logic for authentication, events, chat, etc. The Next.js app also has regular pages for the web interface (e.g. `app/page.tsx` for the main dashboard). Configuration files like `next.config.js` or environment variables for the server reside in this folder.

- **`packages/shared`:** (Optional) A place for shared modules, such as utility functions, custom hooks, constants, or UI components that can be reused. For instance, a validation helper or a data format function could live here. This promotes DRY principles – "Don't Repeat Yourself" – by centralizing logic used in multiple places.

**Future expansion note:** In Phase 2, we will add a `packages/mobile` directory for the React Native application, which will interact with the existing Next.js API endpoints.

## Component Breakdown & Responsibilities

This section details the key UI components, their responsibilities, and how we will manage state in the Next.js web application. We distinguish between **reusable components** (often called presentational components) and **page-level components** (container components), and outline how state and data flow will be handled via hooks and context.

### Key UI Components and Pages

**Authentication & Onboarding pages:** These include components like `SignupForm`, `LoginForm`, and possibly an `OnboardingSection` if there's an introductory carousel. Within these pages, there are form components such as input fields for email/password and buttons to submit.

**Main App pages:** Once logged in, the user sees main application pages:
- **Event List Page:** Displays a scrollable list of events. It uses a reusable component `EventCard` to render each event's summary (e.g. title, date, maybe an image). 
- **Event Detail Page:** Shows full details of a selected event. This might include event description, time/location, list of participants, and actions like "Join Event". It could compose multiple smaller components, such as an event header, a list of attendees (each rendered with an `Avatar` component), and a join button.
- **Chat Page:** Allows users to view messages and send new ones in real-time or near-real-time. It contains a list of messages, where each message is rendered with a `MessageBubble` component (showing the message text, sender, timestamp). At the bottom, an input field and send button allow the user to type and send new messages.
- **Profile Page:** Displays the user's profile information. It might use components like `Avatar` (for the user's picture), and `ProfileForm` or `ProfileDetails` to show fields like username, email, bio, etc.

**Reusable UI components:** These are building blocks used across pages:
- **Form Inputs and Buttons:** e.g. `TextField`, `Button`, `LoadingSpinner`. These have a consistent style and behavior across the app.
- **Display components:** e.g. `Avatar` (displays a user's profile picture), `EventCard` (shows event summary info), `MessageBubble` (styles a chat message).
- **Navigation components:** Though navigation is mainly handled by Next.js routing, we might have a custom `Header` component or navigational menu components that are reused.

Each component has a clear purpose. Reusable components are **presentational**: they focus on how things look and emit events (via callbacks) when user interacts. Page components (or container components) are **stateful**: they handle data fetching (calling APIs), state management, and compose multiple reusable components.

### State Management Strategy

We will use **React Hooks and Context API** for state management. Simpler, local state (e.g. the text in a form input, or whether a modal is visible) will be handled with `useState` inside components. For more complex logic or side effects (like fetching data when a page loads), `useEffect` and custom hooks will be used. For example, we might create a custom hook `useEvents()` that fetches and returns a list of events, and use it inside the Events page to populate data.

For global state that needs to be accessed across the application (like authentication status), we'll use the Context API. For example, an `AuthContext` could store the current user's information and token, providing login/logout functions to components that need them.

2. **Improve error handling** across all endpoints for better client feedback.
3. **Add validation** to all input data to prevent invalid data from being processed.
4. **Create a health check endpoint** (`GET /api/health`) to verify the API is running.
5. **Document all API endpoints** for front-end developers.

## Web Frontend Implementation Checkpoints

## API Implementation Details

1. **Event Model:** An event can be an object with fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `datetime`, `location`, `organizerId`, and `attendees` (list of user IDs). In absence of a real database, you can have an in-memory array or use a simple JSON file.

2. **GET /api/events:** Create `app/api/events/route.ts` to handle requests for listing events. The handler should retrieve all events from storage and respond with a JSON: `{ events: [...] }`.

3. **GET /api/events/[id]:** Create file `app/api/events/[id]/route.ts` to handle requests for a specific event. Find the event by ID and return it (`res.json({ event })`).

4. **POST /api/events/[id]/rsvp:** Create file `app/api/events/[id]/rsvp/route.ts` to handle joining an event. Ensure the user is authenticated, then modify the event data (add user to attendees).

5. **Profile Endpoints:** Create `app/api/profile/route.ts` to handle user profile operations. For GET, fetch the user profile. For PUT, update the user's fields.

## Deployment Guide (Localhost Testing)

To run and test the application locally, follow these steps:

**1. Initial Setup:**

- **Clone Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine.
- **Install Dependencies:** In the root directory, run `npm install` to install all packages.
- **Set Environment Variables:** If the Next.js app requires any environment variables, create a `.env.local` file in `packages/web/` with those values.

**2. Running the Next.js Web App:**

- Open a terminal in the root of the project. Start the Next.js development server:  
  ```bash
  npm run web dev
  ```  
  This leverages npm workspaces to run the `dev` script in the `packages/web` project. By default, it will be listening on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

- **Verify Server is Running:** Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the Next.js web application running.

**3. Testing the App Locally:**

- **Register and Login:** Try creating a new account on the signup page. Then log out and try logging in with the same account to ensure that flow works.
- **View and Create Events:** Once logged in, navigate to the events page to view the list of events. Try creating a new event and verify it appears in the list.
- **Event Details and Join:** Click on an event to view its details. Try joining the event and verify that your name appears in the attendees list.
- **Profile Management:** Go to the profile page and try editing your profile information.

**4. API Testing:**

- You can use tools like Postman or cURL to test the API endpoints directly:
  - `GET http://localhost:3000/api/events` - Should return a list of events
  - `GET http://localhost:3000/api/profile` (with Authorization header) - Should return the user profile

**Phase 2 Note:** In the future, we will implement a React Native mobile app that will connect to the same API endpoints we've built in the web app. The Next.js API will serve as the backend for both web and mobile clients.
