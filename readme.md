## Overview 
This proposal outlines a mobile application designed to connect people through shared events and personality-based matching. The app’s vision is to foster meaningful, in-person connections by making it easy to discover events and meet compatible individuals in a safe, engaging way. A unique personality quiz and compatibility scoring system will **bring people closer together** by gauging how well users might get along ([New App Personality Match Tests Your Compatibility With Family & Friends - Global Dating Insights](https://www.globaldatinginsights.com/news/new-app-personality-match-tests-your-compatibility-with-family-friends/#:~:text=A%20new%20app%20has%20launched,partners%2C%20friends%20and%20family%20members)). At the same time, the platform leverages the convenience of dedicated event apps – simplifying how users plan, join, and manage events, which is **far more convenient than using multiple websites or printed tickets** ([Event App Development: Top Features & Real Example - Perpetio](https://perpet.io/blog/event-app-development-top-features-real-example/#:~:text=No%20matter%20the%20type%2C%20event,are%20now%20held%20in%20hybrid)). Overall, the application aims to create a fun social ecosystem where users can find events, connect in ephemeral group chats, and build trust through profile verification and post-event reviews.
